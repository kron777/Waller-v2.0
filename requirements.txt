# Core dependencies for waller (minimal viable set for first version)
python-mpv>=1.0.6      # python bindings — fallback & future control
psutil>=5.9            # detect fullscreen apps, processes, etc later
pystray>=0.19          # system tray icon/menu (nice to have)
pillow>=10.0           # for loading/processing tray icon image

# Optional / future:
# pywayland             # if we ever want native wayland without mpvpaper
# tkinter               # usually comes with python, for simple GUI later
